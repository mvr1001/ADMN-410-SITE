	<section>
	Durham House of Pets was founded by Dean Anthony Rametta back in 1994. 
	In the early days the company was a very small and only included two employees
	Dean and his wife Mary. The company was inspired by their pet Sydney who was a Black Lab. 
	The company has grown massively over the past twenty years. Durham House of Pets used to only
	sell a select few items but now sells all sorts of pet supplies including Tanks, Food, and Toys.
